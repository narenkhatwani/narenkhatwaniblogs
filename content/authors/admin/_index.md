Hello! I'm Naren, a Data Science Ph.D. student at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT). My research passion lies in the filed of Ontologies, with a keen interest in Massive Scale Analytics. Alongside my research, I am a Teaching Assistant for Advanced Database System Design
Before diving deep into ontologies, I explored the domain of Parallel and High Performance Computing as a Graduate Researcher at NJIT. My professional journey also took me to Forbes during the summer of 2022. As a Technology Engineering Intern in Jersey City, I collaborated with the Platform & Product Engineering Team, significantly enhancing their Content Management System and pioneering the development of the new Mobile Application for Forbes Daily Dozen.
Outside my academic comitments, I am a GitHub Campus Expert, where I strive to build diverse and inclusive communities to learn skills, collaborate on projects, and share experiences. Through this platform, I not only introduce students to promising research domains but also organize collaborative events in partnership with GitHub, Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) - NJIT chapter focusing on open-source learning and innovation.
