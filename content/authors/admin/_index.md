Hello! I'm Naren, a Data Science Ph.D. student at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT). My research passion lies in the filed of Ontologies, with a keen interest in Massive Scale Analytics. Alongside my research, I am a Teaching Assistant for Advanced Database System Design

I write blogs in my past time to help out incoming graduate students. Fortunately I have had great mentors and seniors during my academic journey and they have always taught me to be help out fellow juniors. 

The following content is free to access and I intend to always keep it that way.
