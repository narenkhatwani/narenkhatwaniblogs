Hello! I'm Naren, a Data Science Ph.D. student at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT). My research passion lies in the field of Ontologies, with a keen interest in Massive Scale Analytics. Alongside my research, I am a Teaching Assistant for Advanced Database System Design.

I write blogs in my past time to help out incoming graduate students. Fortunately, I have had great mentors and seniors during my academic journey who have always taught me to help out fellow juniors.

The following content is free to access and I intend to always keep it that way.
