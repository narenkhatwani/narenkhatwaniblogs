I'm majoring in Management of Technology at NYU, combining my love for management and technology. My passion for solving problems and my storytelling abilities made me choose Data Analytics as my specialization. I'm currently neck-deep in homework for my Machine Learning class, but I'm still having fun learning.

I am a data analyst with a passion for solving real-world problems. I am looking for a role where I can use my skills and experience to help a company make better decisions and achieve its goals. I'm always eager to learn new skills and take on new challenges. Let's connect and explore opportunities!
