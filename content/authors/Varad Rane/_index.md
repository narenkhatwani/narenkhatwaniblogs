Hello! Im Varad, a graduate student at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT). I am currently pursuing my masters in Computer Science with a keen interest in Big Data and Deep Learning.

I have also worked after my Bachelors for more than two years as a Software Engineer with Kotak Securities. I have developed windows and web applications and optimized multiple processes and reduced API latency. 

Always ready to help and contribute!
