### Do you always get a response for your cold email?

<div style="text-align: justify;"> NOPE, In 85%-90% of the cases you don't get a reply. Why? Because its not just you who is sending a cold email out to a recruiter or and industry expert. So, please be patient whenever you write a cold email. In case you are an impatient person like me in their 20s where you want super fast responses or want some sort of closure. Please add this at the end of your cold email message:

"Thank you very much for your time and consideration of this request. I understand that you have many priorities and if you are unable to respond, I completely respect that"
