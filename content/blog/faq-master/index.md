Hey ðŸ‘‹Â there, 

Following are some of the frequently asked questions to me about NJIT or other universities in general. I came to know that I was answering the same questions over and over again. So I thought of writing it all down and collaborating with a few juniors to add some information about undergraduate degree too.

Here is a compilation of all the questions,

Apart from the above mentioned resources, make sure to explore and have a little fun on weekends. You are here to study/ focus on your academics but a little fun trip to a nearby city or park wonâ€™t hamper it.

In case you find some errors or some updates to the existing information, let me know how can I rectify it.
