You should get a good Forex Card and an IDP to make your initial weeks easier.

## Get a Forex Card

I personally have a Axis Bank Vistara Forex Card, mainly because on all transactions I get miles which can be used by either my family members or me in future for Domestic Flight Travel in India. This gives you some return offer on the money you transfer via the Forex card. The customer service provided by Axis Bank is amazing as well. 

## Get some Cash

Until your bank account is opened, you might need to use some cash as not all places would be supporting your Forex card. So its good to have some cash with you. If you are carrying some cash, carry small denominations as they would come in handy to purchase groceries or some take out food initially.

## Get an International Drivers Permit (IDP)

You can also carry your IDP around instead of your passport in the initial days until you get your University Student ID, State ID or a US Drivers License.

## Leaving some documents behind in your Home Country

Leave some cheques with your signature or an authority letter with your family members incase you want them to collect some documents on your behalf in your absence. Sometimes there cases where they would be needed to collect your Diploma/ Degree or complete a KYC process and need your signature.
