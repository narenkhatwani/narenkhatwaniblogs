### How is NJIT ?

Personally for me its been a great journey so far, I have had some great experiences. The diversity here is amazing and offers a lot of different perspectives on things which might not have experienced before. You are exposed to some world class technologies and also get to work with it hands on.

### How are the courses/professors?

They are amazing, you get to learn something new from every professor under whom you are opting for any courses. All professors have set the course curriculum as per their choice. So, some courses have a midterm and a final exam along with assignments ranging from every week to bi-weekly submissions. Along with this, some courses also have multiple midterms or group/individual projects. Some other variations can be like only assignments and no midterms/finals or vice versa. If you want to know more about the courses and professors, you can ask your seniors who have opted for the courses before and ask them your questions.

Thank you for reading, I hope you have a great time at NJIT. Do help your juniors in upcoming batches with all the experience you get here because they are also coming to a new place altogether with no prior experience with a different academic style and way of living.  

### Clubs and Organizations on Campus?

There are about 150 organizations on campus. You can join as many as you want. Almost every week, events are hosted by one or the other club. Ensure to follow @lifeatnjit on Instagram, as they post all about the upcoming events from different clubs to avoid missing them. Pull up to those events to know more about the club, people involved, and (not to miss on) free food and stuff like Merch (sometimes). 

Once, you are familiar with the different clubs, you can join them, and its totally on you to join as many clubs, or not join any. 

### Why am I helping you all for?

During my time, I had quite a lot of seniors helping me out and I am grateful to them as they taught me to help other incoming students.

We all know itâ€™s difficult to just switch your country of residence and try to settle down here all of a sudden.

Also its free, but you can always send me sweets/chocolates after you have settled down ðŸ˜‚
