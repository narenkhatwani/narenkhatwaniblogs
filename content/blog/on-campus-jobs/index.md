### Tips and Tricks for securing On-Campus Jobs

- **Complete at Least One Semester:** Wait to apply for a job until you have completed at least one semester, as your GPA is often required for hiring (undergraduates only). However, it's a good idea to look for job opportunities in advance.

- **Gain Insight During Your First Semester:** After your first semester, you'll have a better understanding of how classes work and may become aware of available jobs such as working at help desks or in libraries.

- **Seek Teaching Assistant Positions:** If you want to work under a professor, it's a great time to email them after your first semester. These positions count as on-campus jobs and provide relevant experience for your major.

- **Seek Research Assistant Positions:** Research a professor's current work before contacting them. When reaching out, ask about their latest research projects rather than previous ones, as you want to collaborate on ongoing work.

- **Get Recommendations from Graduating Students:** Ask graduating students to refer you or put in a good word for the position they are leaving.

- **Explore Other Departments:** Don’t limit your job search to your own department. Other departments may have openings that suit your profile.
- **Viewing Fees:** If someone asks you to pay a fee (e.g., $100) to view a listing, be cautious. No realtor or broker is allowed to charge you a fee before showing you a property. This is a red flag.
- **Unavailable Landlords:** Be wary of landlords who claim to be out of town and cannot show you the apartment in person or via video call. They might send you videos and expect you to sign the lease. This is a scam. Always insist on seeing the property before making any commitments.
- **Verified Listings:** It's a good idea to look for accommodations that have been previously rented by students. This way, you can verify the identity of the broker or realtor, preventing you from sending a deposit to a scammer.
- **Arrival Timing:** If you're unsure about the trustworthiness of a realtor, consider arriving a few days before your orientation. You can stay at an Airbnb or with someone you know and look for apartments in person. This reduces the risk of falling for a scam.
- **Overlapping Leases:** While not a scam, be aware of overlapping leases where landlords mix up move-out and move-in dates. This is illegal, and if it happens to you, ask your realtor for reasonable accommodation until your move-in date. Don’t let anyone take advantage of you!


### Things To Avoid

- **Unauthorized Off-Campus Jobs:** Don’t work off-campus without proper work authorization and permits from the university. This can result in permanent debarment from the USA.

- **Over-Mailing Professors/Staff:** Avoid contacting professors or staff too frequently about positions. For example, if you email a professor about a position and they say it’s not available, give it a few weeks before reaching out again.
