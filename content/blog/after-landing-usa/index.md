## Bank Account
Within the first few days you should get a Bank Account so that you can take care of finances from your home country

Some Banks which are well known are Chase and Bank of America

Since you are an international student you should carry the lease agreement (as address proof), i20 and passport in order to open a new account.

Some links for offers to open a new account:

Just like sending money via wallets, here you can use Zelle to send and receive money via your bank app.

## Credit Card

Its better to get a credit card in US to build your credit history for future. The credit history is important if you want to purchase a car. Additionally, you don’t get any interest in banks in US per annum and these credit cards have a decent amount of offers.

You should use credit cards responsibly and always pay in full by the end of the month to avoid being under any amount of debt.

When you land in US you can get a student credit cards which doesn’t need a SSN like Deserve and then build a credit history based off of that. Later when you get a SSN you can move to some premium credit cards.

**Note:**

Please start off with a basic student card and move onto some premium cards after a while, because you need a good credit score and >1 year of account age

## Sim Card
- Major service providers are Mint Mobile, AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint.
- Consider prepaid plans
- Make sure you get good coverage in the area where you live.

If you get an option to be a part of the family plan with other students, please consider that as thats a viable and a great option too

I personally use and recommend Mint Mobile, as its student pocket friendly and has a good coverage (in New Jersey and New York as thats my main residency area). Please ask your seniors to recommend service providers if your universities is in any other state, they’ll be able to help you better

You can use my referral link below and any plan for first three months at 15$/month
