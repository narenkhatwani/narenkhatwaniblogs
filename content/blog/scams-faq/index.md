### How likely am I to get scammed ?

From the moment you step foot in the United States, you may become a target for various scams. However, there's no need to worry. These scams are easily avoidable with the right knowledge. I'll share a few common scenarios where you might be at risk of being scammed without even realizing it.


### First Up - Accommodation Scams

Finding accommodation as an international student can be challenging, and scams only add to the difficulty. Here are some common scams to watch out for:
The most common scams are 
- **Viewing Fees:** If someone asks you to pay a fee (e.g., $100) to view a listing, be cautious. No realtor or broker is allowed to charge you a fee before showing you a property. This is a red flag.
- **Unavailable Landlords:** Be wary of landlords who claim to be out of town and cannot show you the apartment in person or via video call. They might send you videos and expect you to sign the lease. This is a scam. Always insist on seeing the property before making any commitments.
- **Verified Listings:** It's a good idea to look for accommodations that have been previously rented by students. This way, you can verify the identity of the broker or realtor, preventing you from sending a deposit to a scammer.
- **Arrival Timing:** If you're unsure about the trustworthiness of a realtor, consider arriving a few days before your orientation. You can stay at an Airbnb or with someone you know and look for apartments in person. This reduces the risk of falling for a scam.
- **Overlapping Leases:** While not a scam, be aware of overlapping leases where landlords mix up move-out and move-in dates. This is illegal, and if it happens to you, ask your realtor for reasonable accommodation until your move-in date. Donâ€™t let anyone take advantage of you!


### Scolarship Scams

Always contact your university's International Student Office (Office of Global Services) to verify the legitimacy of a scholarship. Never pay anyone to apply for a scholarship.

### Visa Phone Scams

Visa phone scams are among the most common types of fraud targeting international students. Here's a typical scenario: someone calls claiming to be from your university's administration, stating that you have failed to submit certain documents and are at risk of arrest. Alternatively, you might receive a call from someone posing as a federal officer, listing specific documents you allegedly missed. These documents are often legitimate requirements for other immigrants, making you second-guess yourself.

For example, after moving from New York to New Jersey, I received a call a month later, claiming I had failed to report my move to my university and the USCIS. They even directed me to a genuine USCIS form. In that moment, I thought I had made a serious mistake.

Here are some key points to remember:

- **Urgency and Aggression:** If someone creates a sense of urgency and starts being loud or aggressive on the phone, this is a red flag.

- **Verify Information:** If something feels off, do a quick Google search. You are likely to find threads on Reddit or Quora explaining similar scams.

- **Seek Help:** Never hesitate to call 911 or your university's international student office for assistance. They are there to help you.

By staying vigilant and knowing the signs of a scam, you can protect yourself from these fraudulent schemes.

### Job Scams

Job opportunity scams are a common threat to international students. In this scam, someone offers you an attractive job, sponsored position, or unpaid internship with the promise of future job sponsorship. The catch is that they ask you to pay money in advance or work for free for an extended period, claiming you will be reimbursed later. This is a major warning sign.

Legitimate employers will never ask you to pay money for a job or internship opportunity. Be cautious of fake job advertisements targeting students that request completed application forms with personal and banking details, as well as copies of identification documents. Scammers use this information to steal your identity.

Always verify the legitimacy of job offers and internships, and never provide personal or financial information to unverified sources.


### Pyramid Schemes

Pyramid schemes are a deceptive way to exploit international students. Initially, someone may appear genuinely interested in helping you, offering advice on personal issues and suggesting self-help books. They might invite you to conferences and webinars, seemingly offering mentorship. However, their true intention is to recruit you into selling products, often as part of a multi-level marketing (MLM) scheme.

This is one of the more subtle and polite scams, but it is still harmful. Be wary of anyone who pressures you to buy or sell products as part of a so-called "business opportunity." Always research any organization thoroughly before getting involved, and be cautious of schemes that promise quick, easy money.

The best way to avoid getting scammed is to stay informed and maintain a clear head in unfamiliar situations. Scammers can target anyone, and being an international student often means facing constantly changing circumstances. This makes you more vulnerable to those looking to exploit you. Always be vigilant and cautious, especially in situations that seem too good to be true or create a sense of urgency.
