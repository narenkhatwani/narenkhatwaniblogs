## narenkhatwaniblogs

This repository manages all my blogs via hugoblox and netlify. 

I write blogs in my past time to help out incoming graduate students. Fortunately I have had great mentors and seniors during my academic journey and they have always taught me to be help out fellow juniors.

The following content is free to access and I intend to always keep it that way.
